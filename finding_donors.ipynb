    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature.

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "Based on the results above we can see that :  \n",
    "- ***Decision Tree Classifier***\n",
    "    - requires very little time to train as well predict.\n",
    "    - has a very high accuracy on training set (nearly 100% on the subsets and above 97% on full training set) but has a significantly low accuracy (less than 80% on the subsets and barely above 80% on the full set) on the testing set. \n",
    "    - The FBeta-Score reflects the same, tending to 1 on the training subsets, close to 0.55 on the small testing subsets and barely above 0.6 on the full testing set. \n",
    "    - This suggests that the model could be overfitting.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***AdaBoost Classifier***  \n",
    "    - Requires less time to train but takes significant time to predict.\n",
    "    - Has similar accuracies on training as well as testing subsets on bigger datasets - suggesting that the model is generalizing well.\n",
    "    - Predicts significantly better than the decision tree classifier.  \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "- ***Gradient Booosting Classifier***  \n",
    "    - Requires a significant amount of time to train as the data increases, but predicts quickly.  \n",
    "    - The smaller datasets show signs of overfitting as the training accuracy is significantly better than the prediction accuracy, but with more data the accuracies become similar suggesting that the model generalizes well.  \n",
    "    - Performs significantly better than the decision tree and a little better than the adaboost classifier.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Based on the above results, Gradient Boosting Classifier should be the most appropriate model for the task as it generalizes the best and performs better than the other two models, with the only downside of having a high training time. We could've chosen ada-boost as well, but it takes too much time to predict, whereas once the training is through, Gradient boosting classifier predicts quickly."

    "Boosting is the process of using multiple weak classifiers (a model whose accuracy is above chance) to form a strong classifier. We sort of \"boost\" weak learners to form a strong learner.\n",
    "In the chosen model, or the Gradient Boosting Classifier, this is done by making an initial prediction using a weak learner after which at each stage another weak learner is introduced to compensate the shortcomings of the existing weak learners.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A very simplistic explanation would be :\n",
    "- During training a learner is first generated to predict the label(<=50,>50) based on the data.\n",
    "- From this prediction, the loss( based on the difference between the prediction and the actual value) is calculated.  \n",
    "- Another learner is generated to predict the loss after the first step and added to it.\n",
    "- Continue this process till a threshold(such as a certain depth of tree) is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "The loss or the \"shortcomings\" that are to be boosted are identified mathematically by calculating the gradient.  \n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
